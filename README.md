# Orvo1.0-AI-Assistant
### A Python chatbot that answers general questions, provides definitions, solves calculations, and understands spelling mistakes.

# A Detailed Description of the Python Chatbot

This project is a Python-based chatbot designed to interact with users in a simple yet effective way. Unlike ordinary bots that rely solely on pre-written responses, this chatbot combines multiple features to make conversations more natural and intelligent.

## Internal Dictionary  
It uses an internal dictionary of questions and answers to respond quickly to general inquiries. This ensures that common questions are answered instantly without the need to connect to external resources.  

## Online Definitions  
The chatbot is capable of fetching definitions from the internet. When a user asks for the meaning of a concept, the bot searches online and provides a clear definition, making it a useful tool for learning and quick reference.  

## Mathematical Operations  
It can solve basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users can simply type an expression like 25 / 5 + 3, and the bot will return the correct result.  

## Spelling Error Handling  
The chatbot is designed to understand spelling mistakes. This feature allows it to recognize misspelled words and still provide accurate responses, making the interaction smoother and more user-friendly.  


In short, this Python chatbot is a multi-capable assistant that combines a built-in knowledge base, online definitions, math-solving skills, and spelling correction to provide a more natural and helpful conversation experience.
