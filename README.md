# A Detailed Description of the Python Chatbot

This project is a Python-based chatbot designed to interact with users in a simple yet effective way. Unlike ordinary bots that rely solely on pre-written responses, this chatbot combines multiple features to make conversations more natural and intelligent.

**First,** it uses an internal dictionary of questions and answers to respond quickly to general inquiries. This ensures that common questions are answered instantly without the need to connect to external resources.

**Second,** the chatbot is capable of fetching definitions from the internet. When a user asks for the meaning of a concept, the bot searches online and provides a clear definition, making it a useful tool for learning and quick reference.

**Third,** it can solve basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users can simply type an expression like 25 / 5 + 3, and the bot will return the correct result.

**Finally,** the chatbot is designed to understand spelling mistakes. This feature allows it to recognize misspelled words and still provide accurate responses, making the interaction smoother and more user-friendly.

In short, this Python chatbot is a multi-capable assistant that combines a built-in knowledge base, online definitions, math-solving skills, and spelling correction to provide a more natural and helpful conversation experience.
